_Stroom-Docs_ is created using the static site generator [Hugo (external link)](https://gohugo.io/).
The full documentation for _Hugo_ can be found [here (external link)](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

The site also uses the [Docsy (external link)](https://www.docsy.dev) theme for Hugo.
The documentation for _Docsy_ can be found [here (external link)](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/).
The _Docsy_ theme provides a lot of the styling but also adds other features and shortcodes.
You should consult the _Docsy_ documentation in the first instance.
