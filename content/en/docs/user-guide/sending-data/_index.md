Stroom has a simple HTTP POST interface that requires HTTP header arguments to be supplied as described [here]({{< relref "header-arguments.md" >}}).

Files are posted to Stroom as described [here]({{< relref "payloads.md" >}}).

Stroom will return a response code indicating the success or failure status of the post as described [here]({{< relref "response-codes.md" >}})

Data can be sent from may operating systems or applications. Some examples to aid in sending data can be found [here]({{< relref "example-clients.md" >}})
