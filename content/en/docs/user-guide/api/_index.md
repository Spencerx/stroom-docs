  Stroom' public APIs for querying and interacting with all aspects of Stroom.
---

_Stroom_ has a number of public APIs to allow other systems to interact with _Stroom_.
The APIs are defined by a _Swagger_ spec that can be viewed as {{< external-link "json" "https://gchq.github.io/stroom/swagger.json" >}} or [link)](https://gchq.github.io/stroom/swagger.yaml).
A dynamic {{< external-link "user interface" "https://gchq.github.io/stroom/" >}} is also available for viewing the APIs.
