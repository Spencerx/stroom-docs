# Match References, Variables and Fixed Strings

The `<group>` and `<data>` elements can reference match groups from parent expressions or from stored matches in variables. In the case of the `<group>` element, referenced values are passed on to child expressions whereas the `<data>` element can use match group references for name and value attributes. In the case of both elements the way of specifying references is the same.
