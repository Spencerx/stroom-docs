## Using page resources

Use the `image` short code to display an image file that is located in the same directory as the page.
For the short code to work the page must be a leaf bundle (`index.md`) or a branch bundle (`_index.md`), i.e:

```
/docs
   /MyPage
      index.md - #image shortcode used in here
      example.svg
```

or 

```
/docs
   /MySection
      /Page1
         index.md
      /Page2
         index.md
      _index.md - #image shortcode used in here
      example.svg
```

{{< image stroom-oo.svg "200x" />}}


### Captions

The image can be displayed with a caption:

{{< image svg-logo.svg "200x" >}}
By W3C SVG Logo, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=105996438
{{< /image >}}

### Size

The image can be defined with a maximum width (`nnnx`) or a maximum height (`xnnn`).

{{< image svg-logo.svg "120x" />}}


### .png files

{{< image stroom-amber.png "100x" />}}


## Using global `/assets/` resources

For images that are shared by multiple page bundles, e.g. stroom icons, place them in `/assets/images/`.
The image path is relative to `/assets/images/`, e.g. file  `/assets/images/style-guide/svg-example.svg` becomes:

```
{{</* image "style-guide/svg-example.svg" "200x" */>}}
```

{{< image "style-guide/svg-example.svg" "200x" >}}
This is some optional caption text for the image.
And this is another line.
{{< /image >}}


## PlantUML

[PlantUML](https://plantuml.com) is the favoured tool for producing diagrams such as UML diagrams, entity relationship diagrams and other more general architecture diagrams.
The diagrams are written in plain text which makes them easy to version control.
The plantUML syntax can then be converted into image files, e.g. .svg files.

A plantUML diagram looks like this in plain text form:

```plantuml
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: Another authentication Response
@enduml
```

PlantUML diagrams should be saved in a dedicated `.puml` file in the same folder as the page that will display it.
If it is needed by multiple pages then it should be saved in `/assets/images/`.

The build process will convert all `.puml` files to a corresponding `.puml.svg` file.
These generated `.puml.svg` files are ignored by git so need to be regenerated at build time or when you change a `.puml` file.
The images can be generated by doing:

```bash
./container_build/runInPumlDocker.sh SVG
```

You should embed an PlantUML image like this, using the `.puml.svg` file (that may not yet exist, but will have to exist before the site is built):

{{< image puml-example.puml.svg "300x" />}}


## Stroom icons

Stroom UI icons such as {{< stroom-icon "add.svg" "Add" >}} or {{< stroom-icon "explorer.svg" "Explorer Tree" >}} can be added in line like this.
The filename is relative to `/assets/images/stroom-ui/`.


### Icon Gallery

The following are all the icons available in Stroom for reference.

{{< stroom-icons-gallery >}}
