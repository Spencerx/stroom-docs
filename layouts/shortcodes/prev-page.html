<!-- 
Adds a link to the previous page in the current section if there is one.
Relies on pages having set weights and means you can re-order pages
without having to change the previous links.
Does nothing if there is no previous page.

For some reason we need to use NextInSection not PrevInSection.
There is an open issue about it here: https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/issues/1061
-->

{{ with .Page }}
  {{ if .NextInSection }}
    {{ with .NextInSection }}
    <a href="{{ .Permalink }}" target="_blank" class="" style="" title="Previous page - {{ .Title }}&#010;{{ .Description }}">
        <i class="prev-page-icon fas fa-solid fa-circle-left fa-sm "></i>
        <span>Previous page - {{ .Title }}</span>
      </a>
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}
{{ end }}
