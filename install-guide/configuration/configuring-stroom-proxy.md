# Stroom Proxy Application Configuration

The configuration of Stroom-proxy is very much the same as for Stroom with the only difference being the structure of the `config.yml` file.
Stroom-proxy has a `proxyConfig` key in the YAML while Stroom has `appConfig`.
It is recomended to read [Stroom Application Configuration](./configuring-stroom.md) to understand the general mechanics of the stroom configuration as this will largely apply to stroom-proxy.

## Without Docker

As with stroom



## As part of a docker stack
