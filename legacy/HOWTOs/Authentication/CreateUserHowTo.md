# Stroom HOWTO - Create a User
This HOWTO provides the steps to create a user via the Stroom User Interface.

## Assumptions
The following assumptions are used in this document.
- An account with the `Administrator` Application [Permission](../../user-guide/roles.md "Stroom Application Permissions") is currently logged in.
- We will be adding the user `burn`
- We will make this user an `Administrator` 

## Add a new user
To add a new user, move your cursor to the `Tools` item of the __Main Menu__ and select to bring up the `Tools` sub-menu.

![Stroom UI New User - Tools Menu](../resources/UI-ToolsSubmenu-00.png "Stroom UI Tools sub-menu")

then move down and select the `Users and Groups` sub-item to be presented with the `Users and Groups` configuration window as seen below.

![Stroom UI New User - Users and Groups](../resources/UI-AddUser-00.png "Stroom UI New User - Users and Groups configuration")

To add the user, move the cursor to the _New_ icon ![New](../resources/icons/add.png "New") in the top left and
select it. On selection you will be prompted for a user name. In our case we will enter the user `burn`.

![Stroom UI New User - Add User](../resources/UI-AddUser-01.png "Stroom UI New User - Add User")

and on pressing
![Stroom UI OkButton](../resources/icons/buttonOk.png "Stroom UI OkButton")
will be presented with the User configuration window.

### Set the User Application Permissions
See 
[Permissions](../../user-guide/roles.md "Stroom Application Permissions")
for an explanation of the various Application Permissions a user can have.

#### Assign an Administrator Permission

As we want the user to be an administrator, select the __Administrator__ Permission check-box

![Stroom UI New User - User Configuration Set Permission](../resources/UI-AddUser-03.png "Stroom UI New User - User configuration - set administrator permission")

#### Set User's Password
We need to set `burn's` password (which he will need to reset on first login). So, select the
![Stroom UI ResetPasswordButton](../resources/icons/buttonResetPassword.png "Stroom UI ResetPasswordButton")
button to gain the Reset Password window

![Stroom UI New User - User Configuration Reset Password](../resources/UI-AddUser-04.png "Stroom UI New User - User configuration - reset password")

After setting a password and pressing the
![Stroom UI OkButton](../resources/icons/buttonOk.png "Stroom UI OkButton")
button we get the informational Alert window as per

![Stroom UI New User - User Configuration Reset Password Complete](../resources/UI-AddUser-05.png "Stroom UI New User - User configuration - reset password complete")

and on close of the Alert we are presented again with the `User` configuration window.

![Stroom UI New User - User Configuration User Added](../resources/UI-AddUser-06.png "Stroom UI New User - User configuration - user added")

We should close this window by pressing the 
![Stroom UI CloseButton](../resources/icons/buttonClose.png "Stroom UI CloseButton") button to be presented with the `Users and Groups` window with the new user `burn` added.

![Stroom UI New User - User Configuration Show User Added](../resources/UI-AddUser-07.png "Stroom UI New User - User configuration - show user added")

At this, one can close the `Users and Groups` configuration window by pressing the 
![Stroom UI CloseButton](../resources/icons/buttonClose.png "Stroom UI CloseButton")
button at the bottom right of the window.
