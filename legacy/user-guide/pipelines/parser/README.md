#Parser
The following capabilities are available to parse input data:

* XML - XML input can be parsed with the XML parser.
* [XML Fragment](xml-fragments.md) - Treat input data as an XML fragment, i.e. XML that does not have an XML declaration or root elements.
* [Data Splitter](../../../datasplitter/1-0-introduction.md) - Delimiter and regular expression based language for turning non XML data into XML (e.g. CSV)
