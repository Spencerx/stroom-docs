# Application Programming Interfaces (API)

_Stroom_ has a number of public APIs to allow other systems to interact with _Stroom_. The APIs are defined by a _Swagger_ spec that can be viewed as [json (external link)](https://gchq.github.io/stroom/swagger.json) or [yaml (external link)](https://gchq.github.io/stroom/swagger.yaml). A dynamic [user interface (external link)](https://gchq.github.io/stroom/) is also available for viewing the APIs.
